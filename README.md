# AQeye
The AQeye Project by Pranit Sanwalka and Armaan Gupta

Our goals:
Raise awareness about the growing air quality issues in growing cities, and try and get more people to wear masks to protect their bodies from harmful particles and air pollution

Our first Prototype:
An n95 mask (switchable) which reacts in real time to the air quality around it by glowing different colours. This also aims to alert the user when they need to wear a mask, and alert people around the user about the need to wear masks.
