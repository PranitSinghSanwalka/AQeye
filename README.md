# AQeye
The AQeye Project by Pranit Sanwalka 

The goals:
Raise awareness about the growing air quality issues in growing cities, and try and get more people to wear masks to protect their bodies from harmful particles and air pollution

The Project:
A Mask that glows and changes colour, reacting to the air quality in real time via inbuilt air quality sensors, which also streans air quality data straight to your phone, so that you and those around you always know the air quality, and can take measures to protect themselves.
