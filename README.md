# AQeye
The AQeye Project by Pranit Sanwalka 

Our goals:
Raise awareness about the growing air quality issues in growing cities, and try and get more people to wear masks to protect their bodies from harmful particles and air pollution

Our Product:
A Mask that glows and changes colour, reacting to the air quality in real time via inbuilt air quality sensors, which also send you data straight to your phone.
